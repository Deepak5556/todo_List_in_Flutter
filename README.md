# Flutter Todo List App

This is a simple Todo List application built using Flutter and Dart. The app allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks, mark tasks as completed, and view a list of pending tasks. This project is part of my learning journey with Flutter and serves as a foundational example of state management, UI design, and basic CRUD operations.

## Features
- Add new tasks with a title and description.
- Edit existing tasks.
- Delete tasks from the list.
- Mark tasks as completed.
- View a list of pending and completed tasks.

## Technologies Used
- **Flutter**: For building the cross-platform UI.
- **Dart**: The programming language used with Flutter.
- **Provider**: For state management (if used).



## Getting Started

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flutter-todo-list.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
3. Install dependencies:
